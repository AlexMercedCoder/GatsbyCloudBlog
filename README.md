### Alex Merced's Gatsby Front-End

this is another front-end project where I am taking the headless blog I created with contentful.com and creating a variety of front-ends for it using different technologies. To complete this I used GatsbyJS which I used to pull information from APIs and Markdown files into and then use GraphQL queries to use the data on the website.
