Title: Post by Markdown File

Welcome to this page that I created using GatsbyJS which used React and GraphQL.
I created this to learn about how to pull in different data into a GatsbyJS Project.
In this page I've pulled the most recent post from my headless blog (hosted by contentful)
and this post you are reading now is from a markdown file. Both sources were pulled
into Gatsby and then retrieved with a GraphQL query into two separate react components.
Check out page 2 to find links to other front-ends to my headless blog using different frameworks.
